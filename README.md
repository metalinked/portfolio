ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Iâ€™m the developer behind [Metalinked](https://metalinked.net), a company focused on building robust, efficient, and maintainable web solutions.

Below is a selection of public repositories originally developed under my personal GitHub account [`oskratch`](https://github.com/oskratch). These projects represent the type of custom web development I do at Metalinked, using technologies like Laravel, PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, and PrestaShop.
